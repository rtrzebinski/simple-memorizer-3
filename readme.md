Simple memorizer helps efficiently memorizing any question-answer sets.

[Application live demo](https://simple-memorizer.online)

### How does it work

- User can subscribe and learn one of lessons created by other users or create own lesson.

- Lessons created by user might be public (can be used by other users) or private (visible for lesson creator only).

- Each lesson contains number of exercises. Exercises has question and answer.

- While learning, user is asked if he knows the answer to a question. User might gives app the feedback simply pressing one of 2 buttons - if he knows the answer or not. App stores this information and uses it to adjust order of questions being asked.

- Generally questions that user knows less are served more often and questions that user knows better are served less often.

- App engine is analysing previous answers of a user, and serves next questions is optimal order, to ensure most efficient learning process.

### Implementation details

- Application is developed with [PHP 7](http://php.net) and [Laravel framework](https://laravel.com).

- Frontend interface is based on [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com). Views are generated by PHP, separated frontend app is not used at the moment. [jQuery](https://jquery.com) is utilised to add dynamic UI elements.

- [MySQL](https://mysql.com) database serves as data store

- App is covered by automated tests written with [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de) framework. Tests are set up to run using in memory [SQLite](sqlite) database, which significantly speeds up testing process.

### REST API

Application provides WEB interface as well as REST API, which allows integration with external client apps.
